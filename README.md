Welcome to my 45-Day Coding Challenge repository! This project chronicles my journey through a dedicated period of intense coding practice, with a strong focus on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). 
This particular challenge is a special Teachers' Day initiative by VIT Bhopal University, designed to sharpen our problem-solving skills and prepare us for future placement opportunities.
Here, you'll find daily updates, problem solutions, and insights gained throughout this exciting and rigorous coding sprint.
